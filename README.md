# TextRecognissionAIChallange
The challenge is to recognise and layout text in the rather noisy source image made available with and without human hinting and training.


AI challenge open to all, identify and layout/format the text within this document. A:) without,  B:) with human hinting, and C:) Human hinting trained. Then that answers the following question, How much human hinting does it take before a computer algorithm can match or better a human at character recognition and layout.


Here's something of the challenge, as the start of a bigger general challenge description, hints and code base i'll provide.. I don't want to provide too much because that will impact on novel implementations. I will however provide all the basic tools for OCR, say based upon implementations researched and tested in previous text recognission challanges,  and some more enhanced OCR methods to get you started..
I know something similar has been done before and what the best approach identified was then, (not neural nets)..
So I wonder how much AI has improved since then, and how good a result my rather rough and ready, not being an expert in AI text recognition methods by a long shot, can achieve.

Clone this repository and i'll provide detail for how to submit implementations as soon as possible.


All code to be licensed under a BSD, public domain esc, license unless otherwise specified or I feel a creative commons style license is better fitted. (The option may be given).


Winning submissions may ber used by any projects that can comply with the lisense, hence why I may choose creative commons to ensure the authors remain accredited for their work.
